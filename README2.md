# Non-Technical Summary


- We analyzed over 10 years of Toronto ferry ticket data to understand how people use the service and to forecast future demand. Two models were built: one to predict how many tickets are used (redemptions) and another for how many are sold (sales), using daily patterns.
- To improve forecast accuracy, we enhanced the models with real-world factors like weather conditions, public holidays, major festivals, and phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, warm temperatures and special events often led to spikes in ferry usage while COVID-19 lockdown and extreme winter cold temperature reduce it.
- We used modern modelling approaches such as advanced machine learning tools like Random Forest and XGBoost to capture these patterns and improve predictions. Our final models correctly predicted about 98% of daily variation in redemptions and sales, which is a major improvement over the basic model.
- These insights can help Toronto Ferry Services plan ahead, whether it’s adding more trips on busy days, adjusting staffing levels, or preparing for slower periods. The models are also useful for longer-term decisions like budgeting or service expansions.
- This work helps ensure ferry operations are more responsive, efficient, and better aligned with how and when people travel to the islands.


# Technical Summary

- This project aimed to develop a robust time series forecasting pipeline to predict daily ferry ticket redemptions and sales for the Toronto Islands, using detailed data spanning January 2015 to June 2025. The original dataset contained 15-minute interval records, which were aggregated into daily summaries for modeling purposes.
- Data processing involved feature engineering which played a central role in improving model performance. This involved encoding temporal variables such as day of the week, Julian day, month, and quarter, including cyclical transformations to capture seasonality. Lagged features and rolling averages (1-day, 7-day, 30-day) were also created for both targets to reflect short- and medium-term behavioral patterns.
- External datasets were merged using date keys, including Canadian public holidays, major Toronto festivals and events, and daily weather data from Environment Canada (e.g., max/min/mean temperature, precipitation, and heating degree days). The dataset was further enriched by categorizing pandemic-related periods into distinct COVID-19 phases: pre-COVID, lockdown, recovery, and post-pandemic.
- Several machine learning models were evaluated: Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and an ensemble that averaged predictions from all three. These tree-based models were selected for their ability to model non-linear, multivariate relationships. Models were trained using walk-forward cross-validation (4 splits, each with a 365-day test window) to simulate real-time forecasting and avoid data leakage. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using RandomizedSearchCV and manual refinement.
- Two separate models were developed—one for Redemption Count and another for Sales Count. Two modeling scenarios were explored: one including the second target (e.g., Sales in the Redemption model), and one excluding it. While including the second target improved performance slightly, models using only lagged and contextual features still performed strongly, highlighting the predictive value of historical patterns and engineered variables.
- Results showed substantial improvements over the baseline seasonal model. The baseline model performed poorly (MAPE 84–86%, R² 0.18–0.26), while the machine learning and ensemble models achieved MAPE between 10–29% and R² between 0.86–0.98 for Redemption. For Sales, MAPE ranged from 13–52% and R² from 0.87–0.98. Feature importance analysis confirmed that rolling means, lag variables, precipitation, weekends, holidays, and event indicators were among the most predictive features, depending on the machine learning model.
- Visual inspection confirmed that the models effectively captured seasonal peaks, COVID-19 disruptions, and demand surges tied to weather and events. The full modeling pipeline was implemented in both Python and R to ensure consistency and reproducibility. All tools and libraries used were open source.
- Microsoft Copilot AI, available in the Manitoba Government network environment, was used transparently to support code review, visualization, and documentation. All modeling and evaluation decisions were independently verified. The final framework provides an accurate, reproducible, and scalable solution to support ferry service planning, operations, and customer engagement.
